|Hey there, person who wants to give me a job. You came to the right place. I study theoretical physics and I'm rather proficient in Python and LaTeX. Right now I'm learning C#, TS, Svelte, Flutter… <br><br> Review by @JindrazPrahy: <br><br> <img alt="A commenty by my friend telling me my code is rather unhinged. he reason for that is that I often name things rather descriptively and in this particlar case I didn't understand the physics behind the code so I used funny naming convention." src = "unhinged.png"/>  |<img src="bunny.gif" alt="A pixelart by @asaha_pixelart showing a tiny bunny mashing away at a single keyboard key"/><br>This is literally what I look like. When you open an issue this is who has to solve it.|
